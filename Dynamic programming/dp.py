    :Description: 
        Function calculates the largest possible profit one can make given a schedule consisting of weekly incomes and competitions with their pay
        
    :Input:
        :param1 weekly_income: a list of positive integers indicating the amount of pay the person makes if he were to coach that week.
        :param2 competitions: a list of tuples with 3 indexes 
            0: starting week of the competition
            1: ending week of the competition
            2: pay of the competition


    :Output: a non negative integer that indicates the maximum amount of profit that is possible to make given the arguments.

    :Time Complexity: 
        Worst: O(NlogN), where N is the combined length of competitions and weekly_income
        Best: O(NlogN), the same as the worst since the is no way to end the loop early. We have to sort the combined list regardless which is worst O(NlogN) complexity
